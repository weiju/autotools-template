This is a test project to test out how autotools work.

==== Build the test system ====

autoreconf -vfi

in a separate directory:

../autoconf_test/configure
make


==== How it was created ====

1. First steps

I've created a simple hello.c and then some
supplementary files

- AUTHORS
- ChangeLog
- NEWS
- README

that autoconf expects to exist.

Then I made

- Makefile.am

and ran

autoscan

to generate a preliminary configure.scan file.

2. Next steps

mv configure.scan configure.ac

3. Edit configure.ac
